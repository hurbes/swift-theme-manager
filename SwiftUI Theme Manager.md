## 🏗 Architecture

Here's a sneak peek at our awesome architecture:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class IThemeProtocol {
        <<interface>>
        +colorScheme: IColorSchemeProtocol
        +typography: ITypographyProtocol
        +spacing: ISpacingProtocol
    }
    
    class IColorSchemeProtocol {
        <<interface>>
        +primary: Color
        +secondary: Color
        +background: Color
        +...()
    }
    
    class ITypographyProtocol {
        <<interface>>
        +headline1: Font
        +body: Font
        +...()
    }
    
    class ISpacingProtocol {
        <<interface>>
        +small: CGFloat
        +medium: CGFloat
        +large: CGFloat
    }
    
    class DefaultTheme {
        +colorScheme: DefaultColorScheme
        +typography: DefaultTypography
        +spacing: DefaultSpacing
    }
    
    class ThemeServiceProtocol {
        <<interface>>
        +currentTheme: IThemeProtocol
        +setTheme(theme: IThemeProtocol)
        +observeSystemChanges()
    }
    
    class ThemeService {
        -currentTheme: IThemeProtocol
        +setTheme(theme: IThemeProtocol)
        +observeSystemChanges()
    }
    
    class ThemeViewModel {
        -themeService: ThemeServiceProtocol
        +currentTheme: IThemeProtocol
        +updateTheme(newTheme: IThemeProtocol)
    }
    
    class ContentView {
        -viewModel: ThemeViewModel
        +body: some View
    }
    
    class AppDependencyContainer {
        +themeService: ThemeServiceProtocol
        +makeContentView() ContentView
    }
    
    class ThemeKey {
        <<EnvironmentKey>>
        +defaultValue: IThemeProtocol
    }
    
    class EnvironmentValues {
        +theme: IThemeProtocol
    }
    
    class MyApp {
        -container: AppDependencyContainer
        +body: some Scene
    }

    IThemeProtocol <|-- DefaultTheme : implements
    IThemeProtocol o-- IColorSchemeProtocol : has
    IThemeProtocol o-- ITypographyProtocol : has
    IThemeProtocol o-- ISpacingProtocol : has
    
    ThemeServiceProtocol <|.. ThemeService : implements
    ThemeService --> IThemeProtocol : manages
    
    ThemeViewModel --> ThemeServiceProtocol : uses
    ThemeViewModel --> IThemeProtocol : publishes
    
    ContentView --> ThemeViewModel : observes
    
    AppDependencyContainer --> ThemeServiceProtocol : creates
    AppDependencyContainer --> ContentView : creates
    
    EnvironmentValues --> IThemeProtocol : stores
    
    MyApp --> AppDependencyContainer : uses
    MyApp --> ContentView : presents
    
    ContentView --> EnvironmentValues : accesses theme
```

Cool, right? 😎

## 📘 Usage Guide

Don't worry, using this theme manager is gonna be super easy! Here's a quick guide to get you started:

1. 📦 Install the package (we'll add detailed SPM instructions soon!)
2. 🏗 Set up your app's entry point:

```swift
@main
struct MyApp: App {
    let container = AppDependencyContainer()
    
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            container.makeContentView()
                .environmentObject(container.themeService)
        }
    }
}
```

3. 🎨 Use the theme in your views:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @Environment(\.theme) var theme
    
    var body: some View {
        Text("Hello, World!")
            .foregroundColor(theme.colorScheme.primary)
            .font(theme.typography.body)
    }
}
```

4. 🔄 Change themes on the fly:

```swift
struct ThemeSwitcherView: View {
    @EnvironmentObject var themeService: ThemeService
    
    var body: some View {
        Button("Switch Theme") {
            themeService.setTheme(AlternateTheme())
        }
    }
}
```

And that's it! You're now a theming wizard! 🧙‍♂️✨
